# Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django  
- **Frontend:** React.js 
- **AI Features:** OpenAI API  
- **Design:** Adobe XD  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Project Management:** Notion

Our tech stack was specifically designed for rapid development, as many team members were participating in their first or second hackathon with GDI. The project manager selected these technologies, focusing on execution and anticipating that challenges would inevitably arise. Django powers the app's backend, while the frontend utilizes React.js to provide a responsive user interface. We have integrated the OpenAI API to offer AI-generated topic summaries, study plans, and break suggestions. Adobe XD was used to streamline our design workflows, and we relied on GitHub for version control and SQLite for efficient data management. Finally, we used Notion for project management.

# The Challenges and the Solutions
One of our initial challenges was the difference in time zones. Most of our members were located in various parts of the United States, and we also had a team member in South Africa. To address this, we adopted an asynchronous-first workflow, greatly supported by detailed project timelines and management tools in Notion. We scheduled a daily huddle at the most convenient time for most of the team and recorded these meetings to share with members who could not attend. Setting aside this time allowed us to align on goals and address any blockers effectively.

Another challenge we faced was the team's varying skill levels and diverse skill sets. Some members were amid career shifts or completing boot camps, while others had years of experience in full-stack development. Additionally, some teammates did not possess full-stack development skills, as their strengths were better utilized in other areas. Fortunately, our team culture encouraged openness, facilitating discussion about skill gaps. Many team members took the initiative to teach each other new concepts or clarify specific terms.

Lastly, we encountered difficulties integrating OpenAI's API into our framework by the submission deadline. We struggled to achieve consistent responses after each API call. Due to time constraints, we could not resolve these issues before the submission. However, post-project, revisiting this challenge and implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle inconsistent responses would be beneficial. Additionally, enhancing our error handling and session management could ensure smoother interactions with the API in the future.
